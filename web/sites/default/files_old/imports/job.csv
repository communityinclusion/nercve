<p>Mission Statement
<br>Our mission is to enhance the capacity of families to meet the developmental and health related needs of children birth to age three who have delays or disabilities by providing quality services and support to families and their children.
<p>Families from diverse racial, cultural, and socio-economic backgrounds will be involved in decision making at every level of the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Early Intervention System.
<p>The Early Intervention System is funded in part by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, EIP with funds from Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
<p>Description
<br>Helpful Hands REIC works in Passaic, Bergen & Hudson Counties. The New Jersey Early Intervention System (Birth-3yrs) participates in Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDEA) through the implementation of a statewide early intervention system of supports and services for eligible infants, toddlers and their families. In enacting Part C, Congress recognized four urgent and substantial needs:
(1) to enhance the development of infants and toddlers with disabilities and minimize their potential for developmental delay;
(2) to reduce the need for special education and related services after these infants and toddlers reach school age;
(3) to maximize the likelihood that individuals with disabilities ultimately lead productive lives in the community; and
(4) to enhance the capacity of families to meet the needs of infants and toddlers who have disabilities.
To meet these needs, Congress established Part C to provide financial assistance to
states to: Develop and implement a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants
and toddlers with developmental delays/disabilities and their families; Facilitate the coordination of payment for early intervention services from federal, state, local and private sources (including public and private insurance coverage); and to enhance statesâ€™ capacity to provide quality early intervention services and expand and improve existing services.
Congress made clear that the success of this initiative requires interagency and community collaboration in providing and paying for appropriate early intervention supports and services. Part C recognizes that no one will ever be able to offer the full array of supports and services identified on the Individualized Family service Plan (IFSP).
The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), the lead agency for
the Part C Early Intervention System since 1993, with the advice and assistance of the State Interagency Coordinating Council (SICC) has developed a vision and mission that guides and directs the Part C Early Intervention System of supports and services. New Jersey has also established Regional Early Intervention Collaboratives (REICs) to facilitate family and community involvement in the Early Intervention System and to assure that local resources are coordinated to assist families to meet the needs of their infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities.

QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED: 

The individual occupational requirements typically provide at least two methods for applicants to meet the basic requirements of the occupations covered by this standard:

A.       Successful completion of a full 4-year course of study in an accredited college or university leading to a bachelor's or higher degree that included a major field of study or specific course requirements generally as stated in the individual occupational requirements.

Where specific course requirements are not indicated, the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the amount specified by the college or university attended. If this number cannot be obtained, 24 semester hours will be considered as equivalent to a major field of study. The nature and quality of this required course work must have been such that it would serve as a prerequisite for more advanced study in the field or subject-matter area. Related course work generally refers to courses that may be accepted as part of the program major.

B.       Appropriate combination of education and experience that is typically specified in the individual occupational requirements. This method generally requires that an applicant possess a core of educational credit, such as described in paragraph A above, plus additional education and/or experience. The method of determining the number of semester hours required to constitute a major field of study is the same as described in paragraph A.

The quality of the combination of education and experience must be sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant possesses the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform work in the occupation, and is comparable to that normally acquired through the successful completion of a full 4-year course of study with a major in the appropriate field. In addition to courses in the major and related fields, a typical college degree would have included courses that involved analysis, writing, critical thinking, research, etc. These courses would have provided an applicant with skills and abilities sufficient to perform progressively more responsible work in the occupation. Therefore, creditable experience should have demonstrated similarly appropriate skills or abilities needed to perform the work of the occupation.

To qualify based on education, submit copy of transcript or list of courses with credit hours, major(s), and grade-point average or class ranking. Application materials will not be returned. Submit proof of your education with a transcript or list of courses with credit hours, major(s), and grade point average or class ranking. We will be unable to return these to you.
