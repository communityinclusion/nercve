Do you want to know about the latest trends and techniques for producing tactile graphics? Would you like to share your knowledge with others? 
<br>
<br>
The American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) National Literacy Center is sponsoring a two-and-a-half day workshop entitled, Techniques for Creating and Instructing with Tactile Graphics. This workshop is designed for teachers of adults or youths who are blind or visually impaired, braille transcribers, and other service providers producing tactile graphics. The workshop is limited to 25 participants. 
<br>
<br>
Participants will have the opportunity to learn strategies for determining the form and content of a tactile graphic and gain hands-on experience with various methods of producing tactile graphics including collage/foil, capsule paper, computer generated files and various combinations of these methods. Additional demonstrations and resources will be provided with special emphasis on determining when and if a tactile graphic should be used, and which methods are best for specific types of graphically represented information. 
<br>
<br>
Participants will receive an instructional guide and a copy of Polly Edman's book, Tactile Graphics. There is no charge for the workshop. Participants are eligible for a $250 stipend after completing a follow-up training. The follow-up assignment requires each participant to conduct a 2-3 hour training with at least five service providers, covering some of the techniques and strategies from the workshop. (Proof of completion of the follow-up activity will include an outline of instruction with objectives, a list of trainees, and assessment of outcomes.) 
<br>
<br>
Applications for the workshop must be received by Thursday, November 10, 2005. Accepted applicants will be notified during the week of November 14, 2005.

Do you want to know about the latest trends and techniques for producing tactile graphics? Would you like to share your knowledge with others? 
<br>
<br>
The American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) National Literacy Center is sponsoring a two-and-a-half day workshop entitled, Techniques for Creating and Instructing with Tactile Graphics. This workshop is designed for teachers of adults or youths who are blind or visually impaired, braille transcribers, and other service providers producing tactile graphics. The workshop is limited to 25 participants. 
<br>
<br>
Participants will have the opportunity to learn strategies for determining the form and content of a tactile graphic and gain hands-on experience with various methods of producing tactile graphics including collage/foil, capsule paper, computer generated files and various combinations of these methods. Additional demonstrations and resources will be provided with special emphasis on determining when and if a tactile graphic should be used, and which methods are best for specific types of graphically represented information. 
<br>
<br>
Participants will receive an instructional guide and a copy of Polly Edman's book, Tactile Graphics. There is no charge for the workshop. Participants are eligible for a $250 stipend after completing a follow-up training. The follow-up assignment requires each participant to conduct a 2-3 hour training with at least five service providers, covering some of the techniques and strategies from the workshop. (Proof of completion of the follow-up activity will include an outline of instruction with objectives, a list of trainees, and assessment of outcomes.) 
<br>

Expanded Core Curriculum: Independent Living and Recreation and Leisure
<br>
<br>
Saturday, June 25 - Wednesday, June 29, 2005
<br>
<br>
The Perkins Outreach Summer Institute, offered in conjunction with the Perkins Training Center, is for Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVI) working with school age students who have visual impairments. This course will address the Expanded Core Curriculum (ECC) areas of Independent Living Skills and Recreation and Leisure Skills. This institute will introduce techniques utilized by persons who are blind and visually impaired, as well as the instructional strategies used to teach school age children these techniques. There will be a strong component of instruction focused on the role of the TVI in the teaching of these ECC areas. This course will help TVIs to determine how to provide appropriate instruction in these ECC areas while continuing to meet their current caseload demands. Lectures, readings, videotapes, discussion and application activities will be used to explore the content and individualize it. Resources and materials will be shared with participants. 
<br>
<br>
Objectives: At completion, participants will be able to: 
<br>
<br>-Assess the student with visual impairments in areas of independent living such as personal management, home management, organizational skills and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Develop individualized educational plans and programs in areas of independent living and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Implement strategies for teaching social skills, daily living skills and functional life skills to students with visual impairments. 
<br>-Modify instructional methods and materials for students with visual impairments in home management, personal management, organizational skills and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Enhance instruction in the areas of independent living for students with visual impairments through the modification of the environment. 
<br>-Collaborate with trans-disciplinary team members in the Expanded Core Curriculum areas of Independent Living and Recreation and Leisure. 
<br>-Identify and access appropriate ECC resources.

Expanded Core Curriculum: Independent Living and Recreation and Leisure
<br>
<br>
Saturday, June 25 - Wednesday, June 29, 2005
<br>
<br>
The Perkins Outreach Summer Institute, offered in conjunction with the Perkins Training Center, is for Teachers of the Visually Impaired (TVI) working with school age students who have visual impairments. This course will address the Expanded Core Curriculum (ECC) areas of Independent Living Skills and Recreation and Leisure Skills. This institute will introduce techniques utilized by persons who are blind and visually impaired, as well as the instructional strategies used to teach school age children these techniques. There will be a strong component of instruction focused on the role of the TVI in the teaching of these ECC areas. This course will help TVIs to determine how to provide appropriate instruction in these ECC areas while continuing to meet their current caseload demands. Lectures, readings, videotapes, discussion and application activities will be used to explore the content and individualize it. Resources and materials will be shared with participants. 
<br>
<br>
Objectives: At completion, participants will be able to: 
<br>
<br>-Assess the student with visual impairments in areas of independent living such as personal management, home management, organizational skills and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Develop individualized educational plans and programs in areas of independent living and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Implement strategies for teaching social skills, daily living skills and functional life skills to students with visual impairments. 
<br>-Modify instructional methods and materials for students with visual impairments in home management, personal management, organizational skills and recreation and leisure. 
<br>-Enhance instruction in the areas of independent living for students with visual impairments through the modification of the environment. 
<br>-Collaborate with trans-disciplinary team members in the Expanded Core Curriculum areas of Independent Living and Recreation and Leisure. 
<br>-Identify and access appropriate ECC resources.

Tips and Techniques for Creating Quality Tactile Graphics~,~Hello! 
<br>Many of you have expressed an interest in a workshop on Tactile Graphics provided by APH. We are really excited to offer this training. In fact, the response to the training was so huge that we have decided
to do the training a bit differently than we have in the past.</br> 
<br>We feel in order to achieve quality tactile graphics it is necessary to
cover many topics. In our upcoming workshop we will cover:
<br>1. Overview of current production methods used to create tactile
graphics
<br>2. Materials used in each method.
<br>3. Deciding if a tactile graphic is necessary.
<br>4. Questions to ask yourself before designing the graphic.
<br>5.  Tips on designing a graphic.</br>
<br>Because our braille transcribers are all at different levels of experience we feel this workshop is a great TG 101 and needed by all transcribers whether they have no experience or 30 years experience.  It never hurts to get back to the basics!</br> 
<br>We have decided to do this first workshop as a webcast so that as many people who want to attend may do so at no cost to anyone! Later, after you have attended this workshop we will do one in person here in Louisville, KY, to do hands on training in a variety of production methods.  In order to participate you will need to fill out the attached registration form and return it to me by June 1, 2006.</br>
<br>Please note! You will not be alone to figure out how to access the webcast. Our webcast specialist Maria Delgado will be contacting you the week prior to the workshop to help you set up your computer and teach you how to use it. Honestly! It's a breeze.</br> 
<br>We hope you will join us for the training workshop, it really is the best way to reach dozens of people at once and it's just like watching tv, except you can ask us questions and not feel silly talking to your computer!</br>

<br ><br >
<b>Presenters:</b> Marilyn H. Gense & D. Jay Gense
<br ><br >
An Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) profoundly affects a child's ability to communicate, form relationships with others, and respond appropriately to the environment. The effects of autism on learning and functioning can range from mild to severe and will depend on the individua's level of intellectual ability, other co-occurring conditions, and experiences. Clearly, children with dual diagnoses of ASD and visual impairment (ASDVI) experience significant implications for development and learning. The success of educational interventions will depend on the team's ability to understand each child's strengths and challenges and design and implement an educational program that is reflective of these strengths and challenges. 
As with most students who are blind or visually impaired, instruction in O&M is an important core curriculum area for students with ASDVI. However, many of the unique learning characteristics of these students have profound implications on development of O&M skills and challenging implications for O&M instruction. It is important, therefore, that the team considers these behaviors and characteristics when planning for O&M instruction, and determines how these characteristics impact the learner's abilities to move efficiently from place to place. 
This two-day workshop is designed to identify these behaviors and characteristics, and offer participants information and resources to appropriately address each through quality O&M instructional principles. The presenters are the authors of the book, Autism Spectrum Disorders and Visual Impairment: Meeting Students' Learning Needs (AFB, 2005).

Presenters: Ralph Braithwaite-- Limitless Consulting. Cost: $75. Are you getting the "right" people for the job? Have you ever hired someone for a position only to find out that the person is not a good fit for the organization or the team? Do the people you hire perform at the desired level? Do they leave just when they learn how to do the job? This workshop will provide you with the tools you need to improve your staffing and interviewing processes, and teach you some new methods for hiring the right people. Major topics include recruiting techniques for tapping better resources; the staffing spiral-- you get what you settle for; behavioral interviewing-- getting at what you really need to know; questions, questions, and more questions-- whatâs okay and whatâs not okay; and how to keep them once you get them.

Construct a corner chair, a toddler-sized square chair, or a floor sitter.  Build a more complex seating system that tilts in space and has options for a pummel, straps, and other innovative positioning options for the more physically involved child.  Try building a rocker or a T-stool for a student who will benefit from balance challenges or some vestibular input.  Adapt a seat with an insert that will meet the individuals positioning needs.  Inserts can be made for rockers, dining room chairs, Tripp Trapp chairs, or high chairs.  Rocking horses and some ride on toys can be modified with adapted saddles.  Feel free to experiment with chair designs for yourself or for children without disabilities.  9:00 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</p>
<p>
Restrictions:  	Participants should already have taken An Introduction to Cardboard Carpentry or have had some previous experience making adaptive equipment using corrugated material.
</p>
<p>
	It is very important to carefully measure the child before coming to the class. A form detailing important child measurements and suggested chair styles will be sent out to participants upon registration.  Feel free to contact the instructor with questions about measurements or project ideas before the workshop.
</p>
<p>	PDPs are available so long as at least 3 hours worth of follow up activities are completed in addition to attending the workshop.

Do you have a project in mind but feel like you dont have the space, materials, or confidence to complete it on your own?  This workshop is open to anyone with some previous experience in making adaptive devices who would like support with a new project.  Make a little room, a cardboard chair, a switch, a weighted vest, a device that stabilizes or measures, an adapted game, or anything else youve been contemplating with a small group of other teachers, therapists and family members who are doing the same thing.
</p>
<p>
Participants should discuss their ideas for projects with the instructor prior to the workshop.  This way we can do some preliminary problem solving and insure that the necessary raw materials will be available.
</p>
<p>
PDPs are available so long as at least 3 hours worth of follow up activities are completed in addition to attending the workshop.
</p>
<p>
Participants should feel free to wear comfortable old clothing that won't be harmed by dust or paint.  Feel free to bring your own food and drink, but we will also have the opportunity to order sandwiches and salads from a local eatery to bring back to the program.

Explore possibilities for enhancing sensory stimulation opportunities for individuals throughout the life span.  Choose to build a sensory play space based on the little room developed by Lilli Nielsen using artists stretcher frames, Lexan and thin plywood for an infant or toddler.  Make a sensory board, wheelchair tray, or frame for hanging items for an older child or adult.  Plan a sensory room or corner for a school, day program for adults with developmental disabilities, or nursing home.  Stabilize a light or sound display, mount a switch, and hide all the wires for a streamlined cause and effect item.  Make some scented items using principals of aromatherapy, or sew weighted or textured scarves or bean bags.
</p>
<p>
Participants should bring ideas for specific projects to meet the needs of individuals within their programs. If size is an issue please measure the space or the person before the workshop. Bring any specific light displays, music players, textured materials or toys that you would like to use in your sensory devices.  Perkins will supply the basic materials for the supporting structures (wood, cardboard, fabrics, plastics, etc.)

The "little room" is a special environment originally developed by Dr. Lilli Nielsen, a well-known Danish psychologist, to promote active learning.  Children lie inside these box-like structures with favored toys, familiar household objects, and items that have interesting sensory properties hanging from the ceiling and attached to the walls.  All items are kept in the same spots inside the play space so that the child's understanding of spatial relations develops along with curiosity, reaching and active play.<br /><br />

Each participant will construct one large (30âw, 30âl, 25âh) or one small (24âw, 24âl, 16âh) little room during the workshop.  Attendees will assemble the wooden frames, mount the hinges, choose clear plastic or thin wood for the panels, drill holes in the panels or cover them with interesting textures, and put the whole thing together.  Items that can be hung in the little room will be discussed but not provided.  Hanging systems for the toys will be made using string or elastic cord and dowel stoppers or cord locks.<br /><br />

Positive Behavioral Supports: Building Classroom Communities! There are wonderful strategies developed for teaching all students how to make better choices when they want to act out their frustrations, anger, and disappointment. Therese has gathered strategies from many of the experts and designed a session that will change the way you look at yourself as a teacher and the ways you interact with your students! Plus, you will have the opportunity to network and share ideas with other educators like yourself!  <br /><br />

Outcomes: By the end of three hours success will look, sound, and feel like: 

 <br /><br />

Shifting focus from controlling the student to teaching the student personal responsibility.  <br /><br />
Identifying ways to avoid power struggles.  <br /><br />
Helping your students develop thinking skills for handling frustration. 
Sharing how we might eliminate the barriers to relationships that support learning.  <br /><br />
Confidence to apply specific strategies to your own teaching context.  <br /><br />
New energy by working with your peers in a brain compatible environment.

Workshop: 4:00 - 7:00 P.M. (Registration 3:30 P.M.) 
Bangor High School, Bangor, Maine
The challenges of engaging families in education have become ever more complex. Due to the number of single parent households, both family members working, and/or increased work weeks it has become increasingly difficult for many families to find the time to actively connect to their children's education. Other issues, such as language and cultural barriers, can interfere with family engagement. This workshop will identify a variety of processes to engage the school and the community in supporting family involvement. Participants will take with them specific classroom and school-based strategies to increase family engagement, including information from school communities around the nation who are working to engage families. This workshop is highly interactive and designed to encourage participants to think in different ways as they work to develop healthy connections between school and home. <br /><br />

Outcomes: By the end of 3 hours:
<br /><br />
Participants will collectively examine and discuss research related to the importance of engaging families in supporting student learning; 
Participants will explore common challenges to engaging families and identify specific classroom d school-based strategies to increase family engagement; 
Participants will actively explore and identify community-specific barriers to family engagement; and 
Participants will engage in problem-solving processes designed to develop comprehensive and collaborative strategies to increase family engagement.

Increasing amounts are also known with each passing year about the related instructional strategies that really work in developing reading and written language skill. This three-day workshop will explore the neuro-developmental bases of reading and writing as well as the evidence-based instructional practices that are effective across the grade span. 

Day One will concentrate largely on the âhardwareâ (brain functioning) aspects of reading and writing skill development, with emphasis given across the session to the importance of understanding the manner in which individual cognitive/language profiles impact the learning process. 

Day Two will involve discussions of actual participant case studies and student profiles, along with team problem solving and developing learning plans for students. Specific strategy-based sessions will complete the day.

Day Three will provide smaller sessions on a range of strategies from basic skills including phonological processing (older and younger students), word study, explicit comprehension strategies, vocabulary, and written language strategies, to strategies for motor work, memory, and executive skills. Emphasis will be given to best practice instructional strategies (the âsoftwareâ) linked to different neuro-developmental profiles. Learning plans will be revisited on day three.

Outcomes - Participants will:

Identify and describe the manner in which brain functioning impacts, and is impacted by, the development of reading and written language skills.

Begin to develop learning plans based on student profiles and specific needs (for both individual plans and group plans).

Build a repertoire of active reading and writing strategies (pre/during/post) to apply across all content areas.

Leave feeling re-newed, re-energized, and re-vitalized from sharing a learning experience with your professional peers.

Who should attend? Team participation is encouraged (SLP, Classroom Teachers, Special Education Teachers, Reading Specialists, Administrators, etc.). Whether alone or with a team, bring along case studies for creating profiles and learning plans.

Due to the number of single parent households, both family members working, and/or increased work weeks it has become increasingly difficult for many families to find the time to actively connect to their childrenâs education. Other issues, such as language and cultural barriers, can interfere with family engagement. This workshop will identify a variety of processes to engage the school and the community in supporting family involvement. Participants will take with them specific classroom and school-based strategies to increase family engagement, including information from school communities around the nation who are working to engage families. This workshop is highly interactive and designed to encourage participants to think in different ways as they work to develop healthy connections between school and home.

Outcomes: By the end of 3 hours:


Participants will collectively examine and discuss research related to the importance of engaging families in supporting student learning;
Participants will explore common challenges to engaging families and identify specific classroom d school-based strategies to increase family engagement; 
Participants will actively explore and identify community-specific barriers to family engagement; and 
Participants will engage in problem-solving processes designed to develop comprehensive and collaborative strategies to increase family engagement.

The ABC Braille Study is a five-year exploration of literacy environments, skills and experiences of children who are totally blind or have light perception only. A major factor in this study is a comparison of students who are initially taught contracted braille and those initially taught uncontracted braille. The study is also collecting data on the larger issue of how the learning environment impacts acquisition of literacy skills.  Researchers from eight universities, a special school, public schools and APH, included: Ralph Bartley, Liz Barclay, Anne Corn (Project Team Leader), Frances Mary DâAndrea, Jane Erin, Christopher Craig, Cay Holbrook, Stephanie Herlich,  Julia Ituarte, Eleanor Pester, Sharon Sacks, Debbie Sitar, Rob Wall (statistician) and Diane Wormsley.
