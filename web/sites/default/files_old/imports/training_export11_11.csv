Teens and adults with visual impairments must have strong orientation and mobility skills, but they must also have social skills, literacy skills, and self determination skills in order to manage their transportation needs independently. Some individuals with visual impairments will need assistance to plan and carry out travel. The tools they add to their toolbox may differ from those of individuals who will be able to obtain independent travel. During this 1.5 day session we will explore the many tools that individuals can add to their personal transportation toolbox. Topics to be covered include examination of the different types of travel, hiring and working with drivers, determining if one has the option to be a low vision driver, building social competence for travel, and the importance of strong literacy skills as they relate to travel. Dr. Penny Rosenblum from the University of Arizona will conduct this workshop for Orientation and Mobility Instructors, TVIs and others interested in this area.
